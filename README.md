## ROAD MAP & MILESTONES

### Year 2017

This idea is created from @huan on Dec 2017, and write a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12I5k_lhlEyipIdHq270JzEFA8WH5B4VPZKnmjj1YHJs/edit?usp=sharing) from scratch.

### Year 2018

- Oct: The controller of the screen had been upgraded so that it can work without any additional hardward. (we have to use another computer to setup the screen after it turned on)
- Nov: We added a HDMI switcher to manage multiple input signals.
- Dec: We had setup Audio System for the Screen so that the HDMI audio can be played as well.

### Year 2019

We are setting up the team of the project Magic Mirror!

Currently we have 3 members: Professor SONG, PhD LI, and Master CHAI, we are HIRING!

#### 2019 Q1

1. Setup the Cameras!
1. Setup the Microphones!
1. Record the Videos & Audios, and the ability to play them back.

#### 2019 Q2 - Q4

1. Integrate PoseNet & FaceNet with Cameras, so that the Mirror could be able to tell us the following facts:
    1. How many people are in the room
    1. Who are in the room
    1. Who are raising their hands
    1. Who are lower their heads
1. Integrate Audio Speech Recognition with Microphones, so that the Mirror could be able to do the following tasks:
    1. Generate the Text Subtitle in real time
    1. Develop our own algrithms to do ASR (optional)
1. Integrate Text to Speech so that the Mirror can Talk:
    1. Integrate with TTS API
    1. Develop our own algrithms like WaveNet (optional)
