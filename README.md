## ROAD MAP & MILESTONES

### Year 2017

This idea is created from @huan on Dec 2017, and write a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12I5k_lhlEyipIdHq270JzEFA8WH5B4VPZKnmjj1YHJs/edit?usp=sharing) from scratch.

### Year 2018

- Oct: The controller of the screen had been upgraded so that it can work without any additional hardward. (we don't need to use another computer to setup the screen after it turned on any more)
- Nov: We added a HDMI switcher to manage multiple input signals so that we can do switch as easy as push a button.
- Dec: We had setup Audio System for the Screen so that the HDMI audio can be played as well.

### Year 2019

We are setting up the team of the project Magic Mirror!

Currently we have 3 members: Professor SONG, PhD LI, and Master CHAI, we are HIRING!
